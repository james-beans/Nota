# Disclamer:
- I am not sure that this works on windows versions before Windows 10. If it does make an [Issue](https://github.com/james-beans/Nota/issues) reporting it and I will add it here.
- It might work on Linux but I haven't tested if it does. If it does make an [Issue](https://github.com/james-beans/Nota/issues) reporting it and I will add it here.
- It definitely won't work on MacOS.
